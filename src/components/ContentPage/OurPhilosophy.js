        “Learning is not the product of teaching. Learning is the
        <br /> product of activity of learners.” - John Hol

        We believe that skill learning is essential to become good at what you
        really want to become. The art of skill acquisition is different from
        regular classroom teaching. We firmly believe that learning happens when
        you are in control of your own learning goals and with the set of
        co-learners who are also in the path of similar learning journey. Our
        approach is to create a learning environment that allows you to improve
        constantly and to become better version of yourself. You learn best when
        you do it, you solve problems, you create something, you experience it
        and gain confidence about it
